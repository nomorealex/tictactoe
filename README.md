# -----TICTACTOE Made in REACT-----

This project represents a variant of the TIC-TAC-TOE game made with functional components in react.
 
You can play:

    -1 vs 1; 
    -1 vs computer;

How to play:

    So you have a grid of 3x3 mini-boards, 
    then you will have 9 TIC-TAC-TOEs games to solve.

    This grid represents another big TIC-TAC-TOE game. And the logic is the same, you should solve each mini-board, until someone makes a line of X or O in the BIG TICTACTOE game (the container grid of mini-boards).

    Mini-Board change:
        So in the beggining of the game, a mini-board is active.
        So when a player makes a move(alternately), that means the player choose a position of the active mini-board. and that choosen position will decide the next mini-board that will be active.

        AND SO ON, TO THE END OF THE GAME.
